            <h1>Puzzle Game Undo System</h1>
            <h3>Vivek Kilari | <time datetime="2025-05-10 22:43">10-05-2025 10:43PM</time></h3>
            <p>I'm currently working on a halloween themed puzzle game called "Trickstir" for my
            MI 445 Game Design and Development class. It involves rotating a grid of squares
            clockwise in turns to roll ingredients into a witch's cauldron. It's simple, but
            intuitive, fun, and addictive. </p>
            <div class="media-wrapper">
                <video width="400" height="400" autoplay loop muted class="media">
                    <source src="./rotating.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
            <p>One of the core features of the game that I helped implement was an undo mechanic!
            It's super cool, and let's you undo any changes you've done in the game and has a
            (work-in-progress) animation that adds some flair! </p>

            </div>
            <p>The game is already extremely functional, but it'll be done by the end of this month
            and hopefully I can share it then!</p>

            <h1>Good Topology</h1>
            <h3>Vivek Kilari | <time datetime="2025-05-10 22:43">10-05-2025 10:43PM</time></h3>
            <div id="two-colum-wrapper">
                <div id="two-column">
                    <p>I'm a game programmer but alongside my programming abilities, I've been growing as
                    an artist over the years. I have practiced 2D art casually for many years now, but
                    this past Summer and this semester I've started learning the skill of 3D art.</p>
                    <p>There are a lot of difficult lessons and skills to learn in 3D modelling, but one
                    of the more interesting things to wrap your head around is the idea of toplogoy, and
                    more specifically having "good" topology.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="media-wrapper">
                <img width="400" height="400" 
                    src="https://cmuanimation.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419399/head-topo_orig.png"
                    class="media" alt="An image showing two versions of a 3d modelled head with good topology. The left has colored faces for important edge flow on the face.">
            </div>
            <p>Toplogy generally, is a field of Mathematics concerned with geometric objects and
            things related to them. While 3D modelling deals with virtual objects, it does not
            mean we can simply create whatever we want without worry. Building models certain ways
            helps to do certain things with them in a different part or stage of a digital production
            pipeline. To draw an analogy, some could make a really giant website with raw HTML, 
            CSS, and JS theoretically, but the larger it gets, considering the limitations of the
            technologies stop you from being as flexible as you could be in creating more content
            or reworking the website.</p>
            <p>Regarding what good topology is, it can be a pretty varied affair. But in the
            case of video games, where performance, as in efficiency and capability, are very 
            important, so a good rule of thumb is to minimize the amount of individual polygons
            in a mesh to the least you need for your specific use case.</p>
            <p>Additionally, it can be good to have flexible, animatable geometry, so it is important
            to prioritize workflows that make sure most if not all polygons in a mesh are quads,
            as in they only have 4 vertices, and to make sure that there is good edge flow through
            those quads, which will allow for better deformation of important areas of a mesh.</p>

                    <td>The lower the polygon count for a mesh in engine, the less computation
                    is required to effectively render that mesh, thus increasing performance.</td>

                    modelling, alongside increase animation capability.</td>
